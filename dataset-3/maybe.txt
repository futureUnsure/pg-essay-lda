February 2009A lot of cities look at Silicon Valley and ask "How could we make
something like that happen here?"  The 
organic way to do it is to
establish a first-rate university in a place where rich people want
to live. That's how Silicon Valley happened.  But could you shortcut
the process by funding startups?Possibly. Let's consider what it would take.The first thing to understand is that encouraging startups is a
different problem from encouraging startups in a particular city.
The latter is much more expensive.People sometimes think they could improve the startup scene in their
town by starting something like Y 
Combinator there, but in fact it
will have near zero effect.  I know because Y Combinator itself had
near zero effect on Boston when we were based there half the year.
The people we funded came from all over the country (indeed, the
world) and afterward they went wherever they could get more
fundingâ€”which generally meant Silicon Valley.The seed funding business is not a regional business, because at
that stage startups are mobile. They're just a couple founders with
laptops. 
[1]If you want to encourage startups in a particular city, you have
to fund startups that won't leave.  There are two ways to do that:
have rules preventing them from leaving, or fund them at the point
in their life when they naturally take root.  The first approach
is a mistake, because it becomes a filter for selecting bad startups.
If your terms force startups to do things they don't want to, only
the desperate ones will take your money.Good startups will move to another city as a condition of funding.
What they won't do is agree not to move the next time they need
funding.  So the only way to get them to stay is to give them enough
that they never need to leave.
