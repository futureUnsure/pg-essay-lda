August 2002(This article describes the spam-filtering techniques
used in the spamproof web-based mail reader we
built to exercise Arc. An
improved algorithm is described in Better
Bayesian Filtering.)I think it's possible to stop spam, and that 
content-based filters are the way to do it.
The Achilles heel of the spammers is their message.
They can circumvent any other barrier you set up.  They have so far, at
least.  But they have to deliver their message, whatever it
is.  If we can write software that recognizes their messages,
there is no way they can get around that.
