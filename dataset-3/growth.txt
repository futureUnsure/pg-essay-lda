Want to start a startup?  Get funded by
Y Combinator.




September 2012A startup is a company designed to grow fast.  Being newly founded
does not in itself make a company a startup.  Nor is it necessary
for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or
have some sort of "exit."  The only essential thing is growth.
Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.If you want to start one it's important to understand that. Startups
are so hard that you can't be pointed off to the side and hope to
succeed.  You have to know that growth is what you're after.  The
good news is, if you get growth, everything else tends to fall into
place.  Which means you can use growth like a compass to make almost
every decision you face.
RedwoodsLet's start with a distinction that should be obvious but is often
overlooked: not every newly founded company is a startup.  Millions
of companies are started every year in the US.  Only a tiny fraction
are startups.  Most are service businessesâ€”restaurants, barbershops,
plumbers, and so on.  These are not startups, except in a few unusual
cases.  A barbershop isn't designed to grow fast.  Whereas a search
engine, for example, is.When I say startups are designed to grow fast, I mean it in two
senses.  Partly I mean designed in the sense of intended, because
most startups fail.  But I also mean startups are different by
nature, in the same way a redwood seedling has a different destiny
from a bean sprout.That difference is why there's a distinct word, "startup," for
companies designed to grow fast.  If all companies were essentially
similar, but some through luck or the efforts of their founders
ended up growing very fast, we wouldn't need a separate word.  We
could just talk about super-successful companies and less successful
ones.  But in fact startups do have a different sort of DNA from
other businesses.  Google is not just a barbershop whose founders
were unusually lucky and hard-working.  Google was different from
the beginning.To grow rapidly, you need to make something you can sell to a big
market.  That's the difference between Google and a barbershop.  A
barbershop doesn't scale.For a company to grow really big, it must (a) make something lots
of people want, and (b) reach and serve all those people.  Barbershops
are doing fine in the (a) department.  Almost everyone needs their
hair cut.  The problem for a barbershop, as for any retail
establishment, is (b).  A barbershop serves customers in person,
and few will travel far for a haircut.  And even if they did the
barbershop couldn't accomodate them. 
[1]
Writing software is a great way to solve (b), but you can still end
up constrained in (a).  If you write software to teach Tibetan to
Hungarian speakers, you'll be able to reach most of the people who
want it, but there won't be many of them.   If you make software
to teach English to Chinese speakers, however, you're in startup
territory.Most businesses are tightly constrained in (a) or (b).  The distinctive
feature of successful startups is that they're not.
IdeasIt might seem that it would always be better to start a startup
than an ordinary business.  If you're going to start a company, why
not start the type with the most potential?  The catch is that this
is a (fairly) efficient market.   If you write software to teach
Tibetan to Hungarians, you won't have much competition.  If you
write software to teach English to Chinese speakers, you'll face
ferocious competition, precisely because that's such a larger prize.
[2]The constraints that limit ordinary companies also protect them.
That's the tradeoff.  If you start a barbershop, you only have to
compete with other local barbers.  If you start a search engine you
have to compete with the whole world.The most important thing that the constraints on a normal business
protect it from is not competition, however, but the difficulty of
coming up with new ideas.  If you open a bar in a particular
neighborhood, as well as limiting your potential and protecting you
from competitors, that geographic constraint also helps define your
company.  Bar + neighborhood is a sufficient idea for a small
business.  Similarly for companies constrained in (a).  Your niche
both protects and defines you.Whereas if you want to start a startup, you're probably going to
have to think of something fairly novel.  A startup has to make
something it can deliver to a large market, and ideas of that type
are so valuable that all the obvious ones are already taken.That space of ideas has been so thoroughly picked over that a startup
generally has to work on something everyone else has overlooked.
I was going to write that one has to make a conscious effort to
find ideas everyone else has overlooked.  But that's not how most
startups get started.  Usually successful startups happen because
the founders are sufficiently different from other people that ideas
few others can see seem obvious to them.  Perhaps later they step
back and notice they've found an idea in everyone else's blind spot,
and from that point make a deliberate effort to stay there. 
[3]
But at the moment when successful startups get started, much of the
innovation is unconscious.What's different about successful founders is that they can see
different problems.  It's a particularly good combination both to
be good at technology and to face problems that can be solved by
it, because technology changes so rapidly that formerly bad ideas
often become good without anyone noticing.  Steve Wozniak's problem
was that he wanted his own computer.  That was an unusual problem
to have in 1975.  But technological change was about to make it a
much more common one.  Because he not only wanted a computer but
knew how to build them, Wozniak was able to make himself one.  And
the problem he solved for himself became one that Apple solved for
millions of people in the coming years.  But by the time it was
obvious to ordinary people that this was a big market, Apple was
already established.Google has similar origins.  Larry Page and Sergey Brin wanted to
search the web.  But unlike most people they had the technical
expertise both to notice that existing search engines were not as
good as they could be, and to know how to improve them.  Over the
next few years their problem became everyone's problem, as the web
grew to a size where you didn't have to be a picky search expert
to notice the old algorithms weren't good enough.  But as happened
with Apple, by the time everyone else realized how important search
was, Google was entrenched.That's one connection between startup ideas and technology.  Rapid
change in one area uncovers big, soluble problems in other areas.
Sometimes the changes are advances, and what they change is solubility.
That was the kind of change that yielded Apple; advances in chip
technology finally let Steve Wozniak design a computer he could
afford.  But in Google's case the most important change was the
growth of the web. What changed there was not solubility but bigness.The other connection between startups and technology is that startups
create new ways of doing things, and new ways of doing things are,
in the broader sense of the word, new technology.  
When a startup both begins with an
idea exposed by technological change and makes a product consisting
of technology in the narrower sense (what used to be called "high
technology"), it's easy to conflate the two.  But the two connections
are distinct and in principle one could start a startup that was
neither driven by technological change, nor whose product consisted
of technology except in the broader sense. 
[4]RateHow fast does a company have to grow to be considered a startup?
There's no precise answer to that.  "Startup" is a pole, not a
threshold.  Starting one is at first no more than a declaration of
one's ambitions.  You're committing not just to starting a company,
but to starting a fast growing one, and you're thus committing to
search for one of the rare ideas of that type.  But at first you
have no more than commitment.  Starting a startup is like being an
actor in that respect.  "Actor" too is a pole rather than a threshold.
At the beginning of his career, an actor is a waiter who goes to
auditions.  Getting work makes him a successful actor, but he doesn't
only become an actor when he's successful.So the real question is not what growth rate makes a company a
startup, but what growth rate successful startups tend to have.
For founders that's more than a theoretical question, because it's
equivalent to asking if they're on the right path.The growth of a successful startup usually has three phases:

 There's an initial period of slow or no growth while the startup
  tries to figure out what it's doing. As the startup figures out how to make something lots of people
  want and how to reach those people, there's a period of rapid
  growth. Eventually a successful startup will grow into a big company.
  Growth will slow, partly due to internal limits and partly because
  the company is starting to bump up against the limits of the
  markets it serves.  
  [5]

Together these three phases produce an S-curve.  The phase whose
growth defines the startup is the second one, the ascent.  Its
length and slope determine how big the company will be.The slope is the company's growth rate.  If there's one number every
founder should always know, it's the company's growth rate.  That's
the measure of a startup.  If you don't know that number, you don't
even know if you're doing well or badly.When I first meet founders and ask what their growth rate is,
sometimes they tell me "we get about a hundred new customers a
month."  That's not a rate.  What matters is not the absolute number
of new customers, but the ratio of new customers to existing ones.
If you're really getting a constant number of new customers every
month, you're in trouble, because that means your growth rate is
decreasing.During Y Combinator we measure growth rate per week, partly because
there is so little time before Demo Day, and partly because startups
early on need frequent feedback from their users to tweak what
they're doing. 
[6]A good growth rate during YC is 5-7% a week.  If you can hit 10% a
week you're doing exceptionally well.  If you can only manage 1%,
it's a sign you haven't yet figured out what you're doing.The best thing to measure the growth rate of is revenue.  The next
best, for startups that aren't charging initially, is active users.
That's a reasonable proxy for revenue growth because whenever the
startup does start trying to make money, their revenues will probably
be a constant multiple of active users. 
[7]
CompassWe usually advise startups to pick a growth rate they think they
can hit, and then just try to hit it every week.  The key word here
is "just." If they decide to grow at 7% a week and they hit that
number, they're successful for that week.  There's nothing more
they need to do.  But if they don't hit it, they've failed in the
only thing that mattered, and should be correspondingly alarmed.Programmers will recognize what we're doing here.  We're turning
starting a startup into an optimization problem.  And anyone who
has tried optimizing code knows how wonderfully effective that sort
of narrow focus can be.  Optimizing code means taking an existing
program and changing it to use less of something, usually time or
memory.  You don't have to think about what the program should do,
just make it faster.  For most programmers this is very satisfying
work.  The narrow focus makes it a sort of puzzle, and you're
generally surprised how fast you can solve it.Focusing on hitting a growth rate reduces the otherwise bewilderingly
multifarious problem of starting a startup to a single problem.
You can use that target growth rate to make all your decisions for
you; anything that gets you the growth you need is ipso facto right.
Should you spend two days at a conference?  Should you hire another
programmer?  Should you focus more on marketing?  Should you spend
time courting some big customer?  Should you add x feature? Whatever
gets you your target growth rate. 
[8]Judging yourself by weekly growth doesn't mean you can look no more
than a week ahead.  Once you experience the pain of missing your
target one week (it was the only thing that mattered, and you failed
at it), you become interested in anything that could spare you such
pain in the future.  So you'll be willing for example to hire another
programmer, who won't contribute to this week's growth but perhaps
in a month will have implemented some new feature that will get you
more users.   But only if (a) the distraction of hiring someone
won't make you miss your numbers in the short term, and (b) you're
sufficiently worried about whether you can keep hitting your numbers
without hiring someone new.It's not that you don't think about the future, just that you think
about it no more than necessary.In theory this sort of hill-climbing could get a startup into
trouble.  They could end up on a local maximum.  But in practice
that never happens.  Having to hit a growth number every week forces
founders to act, and acting versus not acting is the high bit of
succeeding.  Nine times out of ten, sitting around strategizing is
just a form of procrastination.  Whereas founders' intuitions about
which hill to climb are usually better than they realize.  Plus the
maxima in the space of startup ideas are not spiky and isolated.
Most fairly good ideas are adjacent to even better ones.The fascinating thing about optimizing for growth is that it can
actually discover startup ideas.  You can use the need for growth
as a form of evolutionary pressure.  If you start out with some
initial plan and modify it as necessary to keep hitting, say, 10%
weekly growth, you may end up with a quite different company than
you meant to start.  But anything that grows consistently at 10% a
week is almost certainly a better idea than you started with.There's a parallel here to small businesses.  Just as the constraint
of being located in a particular neighborhood helps define a bar,
the constraint of growing at a certain rate can help define a
startup.You'll generally do best to follow that constraint wherever it leads
rather than being influenced by some initial vision, just as a
scientist is better off following the truth wherever it leads rather
than being influenced by what he wishes were the case.  When Richard
Feynman said that the imagination of nature was greater than the
imagination of man, he meant that if you just keep following the
truth you'll discover cooler things than you could ever have made
up. For startups, growth is a constraint much like truth. Every
successful startup is at least partly a product of the imagination
of growth.

ValueIt's hard to find something that grows consistently at several
percent a week, but if you do you may have found something surprisingly
valuable.  If we project forward we see why.
